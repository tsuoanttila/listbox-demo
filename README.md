# ListBox Demo #

This repository contains, in commits, step by step how I constructed a Vaadin server-side component
with GWT ListBox as the client-side widget. I used the Bean DataSource (see 
http://github.com/tsuoanttila/bean-datasource ) as the data storage.

This project acts as an example of how to use Bean DataSource for your own component development.
